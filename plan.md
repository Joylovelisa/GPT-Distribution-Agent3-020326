Working plan of 2026-1-27
Tasks
1.Please read app.py and improve the design by creating a new WOW UI that user can use keyword to seach multiple datasets at the same time and system will present results in interactive visualization ways and user can click to see further information. User can also modify search settings to further dig into dataset. System will also give suggestions for further search. User can keep prompt on the results or use agents from agents.yaml to visualization and analysis datasets. Please don't create or modify codes and only create a comprehensive technical specification in markdown in 3000~4000 words. Please include all 4 mock datasets (510(k), recall, adr, gudid) in the specifications. This system to be deployed on hugging face space using streamlit, SKILL.md, agents.yaml, OPENAI API, GEMINI API. User can provide api key on webpage if not get from the environment. Don't show api key if get from the environment. First user paste (text, markdown) or upload files(text, markdown, pdf), user can preview the upload pdf in pdf view. Then system will use python package to trim the pdf and do OCR (user decide which pages to trim and do OCR, user can choose to use python packages or LLM based OCR). Then system will reorganized the doc into markdown with keywords in coral color. User can modify the doc in markdown or text view. Then user can keep prompt on the doc or select agents from agents.yaml to execute on the doc (user can modify the prompt and select models gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-3-flash-preview, gpt-4o-mini). Please also create a feature that user can modify (modify the prompt and select models), download, upload agents.yaml, SKILL.md. If the upload agents.yaml is not standarized agents.yaml, please transform it into standardized agents.yaml then user can modify the agents.yaml.
2.Please create technical specification in markdown in 2000~3000 words for a agentic ai system that will first find all pdf files in the working folder. Then system will trim frist page of each pdf and create summary of each trimmed files in markdown (save in .md). Then system will create a table of content doc (ToC doc) in markdown combined all previous created summary. Then user can keep prompt on the ToC doc (user can select models) or select agents from agent.yaml to execute on the ToC doc. agentic ai system to be deployed on hugging face space using streamlit, SKILL.md, agents.yaml, OPENAI API, GEMINI API.User can provide api key on webpage if not get from the environment. Don't show api key if get from the environment.
