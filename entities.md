# Key Entities in FDA Agentic AI System

| Entity | Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FDA** | The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory body whose standards (510(k), Recalls) define the data and workflows of this system. |
| **510(k)** | A premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. One of the 4 core datasets. |
| **Agentic AI** | The core technology utilizing autonomous LLM agents (defined in `agents.yaml`) to perform complex tasks like document analysis and risk assessment without constant human intervention. |
| **Recall** | A method of removing or correcting products that are in violation of laws administered by the FDA. The system visualizes recall severity and history. |
| **ADR / MDR** | Adverse Drug/Device Reaction (Medical Device Reporting). A database of adverse events that the system cross-references to identify safety signals. |
| **GUDID** | Global Unique Device Identification Database. Used by the system to retrieve standardized device attributes like single-use, sterile, or MRI safety status. |
| **Streamlit** | The open-source Python framework used to build the "WOW" interactive web interface, chosen for its rapid development capabilities and data support. |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | The cloud hosting platform targeted for deployment, providing an accessible environment for the Streamlit application. |
| **Coral** | The specific color theme (`#FF7F50`) used to highlight critical regulatory keywords (e.g., "Warning", "Predicate") in the UI and processed documents. |
| **OCR** | Optical Character Recognition. A critical pipeline step where the system converts scanned PDF pages into machine-readable text using tools like Tesseract or Vision LLMs. |
| **Batch Processing** | A system mode designed to iterate through large directories of PDF files, performing automated trimming and summarization to create a master index. |
| **agents.yaml** | The configuration file that defines the persona, model, system prompt, and capabilities of each AI Agent available in the system. |
| **Master ToC** | Master Table of Contents. An aggregated document generated by the Batch Processor that combines summaries of all files in a project for high-level analysis. |
| **PDF Trimming** | The process of removing irrelevant pages (like cover sheets) from a PDF before OCR or analysis to save tokens and improve relevance. |
| **OpenAI API** | A cloud provider used for high-intelligence tasks (e.g. GPT-4o) including complex reasoning and vision-based OCR. |
| **Gemini API** | A cloud provider (Google) offering models like Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash, utilized for their large context windows and cost-efficiency in document processing. |
| **Markdown** | The standardized output format for all system reports and document conversions, enabling easy editing and formatting with Coral highlights. |
| **Vision LLM** | Advanced AI models (e.g., GPT-4o Vision) used to "read" PDF pages as images, preserving table structure and layout better than traditional OCR. |
| **PyPDF2** | A Python library used in the backend for basic PDF manipulation tasks such as reading page counts and splitting/trimming files. |
| **Rapidfuzz** | A fast string matching library used by the search engine to perform fuzzy keyword matching across the multiple JSON datasets. |
